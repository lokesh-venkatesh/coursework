This folder contains the details of all of the courses I have taken over my 7 semesters at IISER. Specifically for courses that involve programming assignments or a heavy applied-quantitative set of tools, I have included any code that I had written as well in subfolders.

In particular, the following courses involved coding related assignments:
1. Bioinformatics (Semester 5)
2. Applied Mathematical Methods (Semester 5)
3. Cellular Biophysics I (Semester 5)
4. Cellular Biophysics II (Semester 6)
5. Image and Viedo Processing using Deep Learning (Semester 6)
